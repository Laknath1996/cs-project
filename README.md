# Exploring Low-Rank and Sparse Approximations for Transformers

Course project for EN.520.648 Compressed Sensing &amp; Sparse Recovery group project at JHU. This repo contains code for implementing robust PCA [1] and GreGoDec [2, 3] for finding approximations for the weight matrices in the Transformer attention layers.

Group: Ashwin De Silva (@Laknath1996), Esther Whang (@EstherWhang)
