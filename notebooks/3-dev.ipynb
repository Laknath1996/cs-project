      "7, or doing last year 's taxes with your ex-wife . \n",
      "8, you do n't have to know about music to appreciate the film 's easygoing blend of comedy and romance . \n",
      "9, in exactly 89 minutes , most of which passed as slowly as if i 'd been sitting naked on an igloo , formula 51 sank from quirky to jerky to utter turkey . \n",
      "10, the mesmerizing performances of the leads keep the film grounded and keep the audience riveted . \n",
      "11, it takes a strange kind of laziness to waste the talents of robert forster , anne meara , eugene levy , and reginald veljohnson all in the same movie . \n",
      "12, ... the film suffers from a lack of humor ( something needed to balance out the violence ) ... \n",
      "13, we root for ( clara and paul ) , even like them , though perhaps it 's an emotion closer to pity . \n",
      "14, even horror fans will most likely not find what they 're seeking with trouble every day ; the movie lacks both thrills and humor . \n",
      "15, a gorgeous , high-spirited musical from india that exquisitely blends music , dance , song , and high drama . \n",
      "16, the emotions are raw and will strike a nerve with anyone who 's ever had family trauma . \n",
      "17, audrey tatou has a knack for picking roles that magnify her outrageous charm , and in this literate french comedy , she 's as morning-glory exuberant as she was in am√©lie . \n",
      "18, ... the movie is just a plain old monster . \n",
      "19, in its best moments , resembles a bad high school production of grease , without benefit of song . \n",
      "20, pumpkin takes an admirable look at the hypocrisy of political correctness , but it does so with such an uneven tone that you never know when humor ends and tragedy begins . \n",

      "25, nicks , seemingly uncertain what 's going to make people laugh , runs the gamut from stale parody to raunchy sex gags to formula romantic comedy . \n",
      "26, the action switches between past and present , but the material link is too tenuous to anchor the emotional connections that purport to span a 125-year divide . \n",
      "27, it 's an offbeat treat that pokes fun at the democratic exercise while also examining its significance for those who take part . \n",

      "32, a gorgeous , witty , seductive movie . \n",
      "33, if the movie succeeds in instilling a wary sense of ` there but for the grace of god , ' it is far too self-conscious to draw you deeply into its world . \n",
      "34, it does n't believe in itself , it has no sense of humor ... it 's just plain bored . \n",
      "35, a sequence of ridiculous shoot - 'em - up scenes . \n",
      "36, the weight of the piece , the unerring professionalism of the chilly production , and the fascination embedded in the lurid topic prove recommendation enough . \n",
      "37, ( w ) hile long on amiable monkeys and worthy environmentalism , jane goodall 's wild chimpanzees is short on the thrills the oversize medium demands . \n",
      "38, as surreal as a dream and as detailed as a photograph , as visually dexterous as it is at times imaginatively overwhelming . \n",
      "39, escaping the studio , piccoli is warmly affecting and so is this adroitly minimalist movie . \n",
      "40, there 's ... tremendous energy from the cast , a sense of playfulness and excitement that seems appropriate . \n",
      "41, this illuminating documentary transcends our preconceived vision of the holy land and its inhabitants , revealing the human complexities beneath . \n",
      "42, the subtle strength of `` elling '' is that it never loses touch with the reality of the grim situation . \n",
      "43, holm ... embodies the character with an effortlessly regal charisma . \n",
      "44, the title not only describes its main characters , but the lazy people behind the camera as well . \n",
      "45, it offers little beyond the momentary joys of pretty and weightless intellectual entertainment . \n",
      "46, a synthesis of cliches and absurdities that seems positively decadent in its cinematic flash and emptiness . \n",
      "47, a subtle and well-crafted ( for the most part ) chiller . \n",
      "48, has a lot of the virtues of eastwood at his best . \n",
      "49, it 's hampered by a lifetime-channel kind of plot and a lead actress who is out of her depth . \n",
      "50, it feels like an after-school special gussied up with some fancy special effects , and watching its rote plot points connect is about as exciting as gazing at an egg timer for 93 minutes . \n",
      "51, for the most part , director anne-sophie birot 's first feature is a sensitive , extraordinarily well-acted drama . \n",
      "52, mr. tsai is a very original artist in his medium , and what time is it there ? \n",
      "53, sade is an engaging look at the controversial eponymous and fiercely atheistic hero . \n",
      "54, so devoid of any kind of intelligible story that it makes films like xxx and collateral damage seem like thoughtful treatises \n",
      "55, a tender , heartfelt family drama . \n",
      "56, ... a hollow joke told by a cinematic gymnast having too much fun embellishing the misanthropic tale to actually engage it . \n",
      "57, the cold turkey would 've been a far better title . \n",
      "58, manages to be both repulsively sadistic and mundane . \n",
      "59, it 's just disappointingly superficial -- a movie that has all the elements necessary to be a fascinating , involving character study , but never does more than scratch the surface . \n",
      "60, this is a story of two misfits who do n't stand a chance alone , but together they are magnificent . \n",
      "61, schaeffer has to find some hook on which to hang his persistently useless movies , and it might as well be the resuscitation of the middle-aged character . \n",
      "62, the primitive force of this film seems to bubble up from the vast collective memory of the combatants . \n",
      "63, on this tricky topic , tadpole is very much a step in the right direction , with its blend of frankness , civility and compassion . \n",
      "64, the script kicks in , and mr. hartley 's distended pace and foot-dragging rhythms follow . \n",
      "65, you wonder why enough was n't just a music video rather than a full-length movie . \n",
      "66, if you 're hard up for raunchy college humor , this is your ticket right here . \n",
      "67, a fast , funny , highly enjoyable movie . \n",
      "68, good old-fashioned slash-and-hack is back ! \n",
      "69, this one is definitely one to skip , even for horror movie fanatics . \n",
      "70, for all its impressive craftsmanship , and despite an overbearing series of third-act crescendos , lily chou-chou never really builds up a head of emotional steam . \n",
      "71, exquisitely nuanced in mood tics and dialogue , this chamber drama is superbly acted by the deeply appealing veteran bouquet and the chilling but quite human berling . \n",
      "72, uses high comedy to evoke surprising poignance . \n",
      "73, one of creepiest , scariest movies to come along in a long , long time , easily rivaling blair witch or the others . \n",
      "74, a string of rehashed sight gags based in insipid vulgarity . \n",
      "75, among the year 's most intriguing explorations of alientation . \n",
      "76, the movie fails to live up to the sum of its parts . \n",
      "77, the son 's room is a triumph of gentility that earns its moments of pathos . \n",
      "78, there is nothing outstanding about this film , but it is good enough and will likely be appreciated most by sailors and folks who know their way around a submarine . \n",
      "79, this is a train wreck of an action film -- a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to force-feed james bond into the mindless xxx mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs . \n",
      "80, the draw ( for `` big bad love '' ) is a solid performance by arliss howard . \n",
      "81, green might want to hang onto that ski mask , as robbery may be the only way to pay for his next project . \n",
      "82, it 's one pussy-ass world when even killer-thrillers revolve around group therapy sessions . \n",
      "83, though it 's become almost redundant to say so , major kudos go to leigh for actually casting people who look working-class . \n",
      "84, the band 's courage in the face of official repression is inspiring , especially for aging hippies ( this one included ) . \n",
      "85, the movie achieves as great an impact by keeping these thoughts hidden as ... ( quills ) did by showing them . \n",
      "86, the film flat lines when it should peak and is more missed opportunity and trifle than dark , decadent truffle . \n",
      "87, jaglom ... put ( s ) the audience in the privileged position of eavesdropping on his characters \n",
      "88, fresnadillo 's dark and jolting images have a way of plying into your subconscious like the nightmare you had a week ago that wo n't go away . \n",
      "89, we know the plot 's a little crazy , but it held my interest from start to finish . \n",
      "90, it 's a scattershot affair , but when it hits its mark it 's brilliant . \n",
      "91, hardly a masterpiece , but it introduces viewers to a good charitable enterprise and some interesting real people . \n",
      "92, you wo n't like roger , but you will quickly recognize him . \n",
      "93, if steven soderbergh 's ` solaris ' is a failure it is a glorious failure . \n",
      "94, byler reveals his characters in a way that intrigues and even fascinates us , and he never reduces the situation to simple melodrama . \n",
      "95, this riveting world war ii moral suspense story deals with the shadow side of american culture : racial prejudice in its ugly and diverse forms . \n",
      "96, it 's difficult to imagine the process that produced such a script , but here 's guessing that spray cheese and underarm noises played a crucial role . \n",
      "97, no sophomore slump for director sam mendes , who segues from oscar winner to oscar-winning potential with a smooth sleight of hand . \n",
      "98, on the whole , the movie lacks wit , feeling and believability to compensate for its incessant coarseness and banality . \n",
      "99, why make a documentary about these marginal historical figures ? \n",
      "100, neither parker nor donovan is a typical romantic lead , but they bring a fresh , quirky charm to the formula . \n",
      "101, his last movie was poetically romantic and full of indelible images , but his latest has nothing going for it . \n",
      "102, does paint some memorable images ... , but makhmalbaf keeps her distance from the characters \n",
      "103, a gripping movie , played with performances that are all understated and touching . \n",
      "104, it 's one of those baseball pictures where the hero is stoic , the wife is patient , the kids are as cute as all get-out and the odds against success are long enough to intimidate , but short enough to make a dream seem possible . \n",
      "105, combining quick-cut editing and a blaring heavy metal much of the time , beck seems to be under the illusion that he 's shooting the latest system of a down video . \n",
      "106, the movie 's relatively simple plot and uncomplicated morality play well with the affable cast . \n",
      "107, what the director ca n't do is make either of val kilmer 's two personas interesting or worth caring about . \n",
      "108, too often , the viewer is n't reacting to humor so much as they are wincing back in repugnance . \n",
      "109, it 's great escapist fun that recreates a place and time that will never happen again . \n",
      "110, scores no points for originality , wit , or intelligence . \n",
      "111, there is n't nearly enough fun here , despite the presence of some appealing ingredients . \n",
      "112, hilariously inept and ridiculous . \n",
      "113, this movie is maddening . \n",
      "114, it haunts you , you ca n't forget it , you admire its conception and are able to resolve some of the confusions you had while watching it . \n",
      "115, sam mendes has become valedictorian at the school for soft landings and easy ways out . \n",
      "116, one of the smartest takes on singles culture i 've seen in a long time . \n",
      "117, moody , heartbreaking , and filmed in a natural , unforced style that makes its characters seem entirely convincing even when its script is not . \n",
      "118, every nanosecond of the the new guy reminds you that you could be doing something else far more pleasurable . \n",
      "119, comes ... uncomfortably close to coasting in the treads of the bicycle thief . \n",
      "120, warm water under a red bridge is a quirky and poignant japanese film that explores the fascinating connections between women , water , nature , and sexuality . \n",
      "121, it seems to me the film is about the art of ripping people off without ever letting them consciously know you have done so \n",
      "122, old-form moviemaking at its best . \n",
      "123, turns potentially forgettable formula into something strangely diverting . \n",
      "124, ( lawrence bounces ) all over the stage , dancing , running , sweating , mopping his face and generally displaying the wacky talent that brought him fame in the first place . \n",
      "125, a movie that reminds us of just how exciting and satisfying the fantasy cinema can be when it 's approached with imagination and flair . \n",
      "126, confirms the nagging suspicion that ethan hawke would be even worse behind the camera than he is in front of it . \n",
      "127, in the end , we are left with something like two ships passing in the night rather than any insights into gay love , chinese society or the price one pays for being dishonest . \n",
      "128, montias ... pumps a lot of energy into his nicely nuanced narrative and surrounds himself with a cast of quirky -- but not stereotyped -- street characters . \n",
      "129, it provides the grand , intelligent entertainment of a superior cast playing smart people amid a compelling plot . \n",
      "130, suffers from the lack of a compelling or comprehensible narrative . \n",
      "131, in execution , this clever idea is far less funny than the original , killers from space . \n",
      "132, scooby dooby doo / and shaggy too / you both look and sound great . \n",
      "133, the tale of tok ( andy lau ) , a sleek sociopath on the trail of o ( takashi sorimachi ) , the most legendary of asian hitmen , is too scattershot to take hold . \n",
      "134, it all drags on so interminably it 's like watching a miserable relationship unfold in real time . \n",
      "135, pumpkin means to be an outrageous dark satire on fraternity life , but its ambitions far exceed the abilities of writer adam larson broder and his co-director , tony r. abrams , in their feature debut . \n",
      "136, looks and feels like a project better suited for the small screen . \n",
      "137, forced , familiar and thoroughly condescending . \n",
      "138, that is a compliment to kuras and miller . \n",
      "139, it 's not the ultimate depression-era gangster movie . \n",
      "140, sacrifices the value of its wealth of archival foot-age with its less-than-objective stance . \n",
      "141, the character of zigzag is not sufficiently developed to support a film constructed around him . \n",
      "142, what better message than ` love thyself ' could young women of any size receive ? \n",
      "143, a solid film ... but more conscientious than it is truly stirring . \n",
      "144, while ( hill ) has learned new tricks , the tricks alone are not enough to salvage this lifeless boxing film . \n",
      "145, the best that can be said about the work here of scottish director ritchie ... is that he obviously does n't have his heart in it . \n",
      "146, about a manga-like heroine who fights back at her abusers , it 's energetic and satisfying if not deep and psychological . \n",
      "147, the talented and clever robert rodriguez perhaps put a little too much heart into his first film and did n't reserve enough for his second . \n",
      "148, feels too formulaic and too familiar to produce the transgressive thrills of early underground work . \n",
      "149, the volatile dynamics of female friendship is the subject of this unhurried , low-key film that is so off-hollywood that it seems positively french in its rhythms and resonance . \n",
      "150, overall very good for what it 's trying to do . \n",
      "151, a big , gorgeous , sprawling swashbuckler that delivers its diversions in grand , uncomplicated fashion . \n",
      "152, a difficult , absorbing film that manages to convey more substance despite its repetitions and inconsistencies than do most films than are far more pointed and clear . \n",
      "153, the heavy-handed film is almost laughable as a consequence . \n",
      "154, a solid examination of the male midlife crisis . \n",
      "155, a nightmare date with a half-formed wit done a great disservice by a lack of critical distance and a sad trust in liberal arts college bumper sticker platitudes . \n",
      "156, manages to transcend the sex , drugs and show-tunes plot into something far richer . \n",
      "157, it takes talent to make a lifeless movie about the most heinous man who ever lived . \n",
      "158, by getting myself wrapped up in the visuals and eccentricities of many of the characters , i found myself confused when it came time to get to the heart of the movie . \n",
      "159, like leon , it 's frustrating and still oddly likable . \n",
      "160, uncommonly stylish but equally silly ... the picture fails to generate much suspense , nor does it ask searching enough questions to justify its pretensions . \n",
      "161, not exactly the bees knees \n",
      "162, there seems to be no clear path as to where the story 's going , or how long it 's going to take to get there . \n",
      "163, slapstick buffoonery can tickle many a preschooler 's fancy , but when it costs a family of four about $ 40 to see a film in theaters , why spend money on a dog like this when you can rent a pedigree instead ? \n",
      "164, a woman 's pic directed with resonance by ilya chaiken . \n",
      "165, may reawaken discussion of the kennedy assassination but this fictional film looks made for cable rather than for the big screen . \n",
      "166, characters still need to function according to some set of believable and comprehensible impulses , no matter how many drugs they do or how much artistic license avary employs . \n",
      "167, the end result is a film that 's neither . \n",
      "168, manages to be sweet and wickedly satisfying at the same time . \n",
      "169, leigh 's film is full of memorable performances from top to bottom . \n",
      "170, it 's also , clearly , great fun . \n",
      "171, rarely has leukemia looked so shimmering and benign . \n",
      "172, it seems like i have been waiting my whole life for this movie and now i ca n't wait for the sequel . \n",
      "173, determined to be fun , and bouncy , with energetic musicals , the humor did n't quite engage this adult . \n",
      "174, if you dig on david mamet 's mind tricks ... rent this movie and enjoy ! \n",
      "175, bleakly funny , its characters all the more touching for refusing to pity or memorialize themselves . \n",
      "176, delivers the same old same old , tarted up with latin flava and turned out by hollywood playas . \n",
      "177, does n't offer much besides glib soullessness , raunchy language and a series of brutal set pieces ... that raise the bar on stylized screen violence . \n",
      "178, it made me want to wrench my eyes out of my head and toss them at the screen . \n",
      "179, the film 's performances are thrilling . \n",
      "180, unfortunately , it 's not silly fun unless you enjoy really bad movies . \n",
      "181, it 's a bad thing when a movie has about as much substance as its end credits blooper reel . \n",
      "182, i sympathize with the plight of these families , but the movie does n't do a very good job conveying the issue at hand . \n",
      "183, the lower your expectations , the more you 'll enjoy it . \n",

      "835, a giggle-inducing comedy with snappy dialogue and winning performances by an unlikely team of oscar-winners : susan sarandon and goldie hawn . \n",
      "836, it 's too self-important and plodding to be funny , and too clipped and abbreviated to be an epic . \n",
      "837, will amuse and provoke adventurous adults in specialty venues . \n",
      "838, sometimes seems less like storytelling than something the otherwise compelling director needed to get off his chest . \n",
      "839, but this films lacks the passion required to sell the material . \n",
      "840, what is 100 % missing here is a script of even the most elemental literacy , an inkling of genuine wit , and anything resembling acting . \n",
      "841, there 's a wickedly subversive bent to the best parts of birthday girl . \n",
      "842, a better title , for all concerned , might be swept under the rug . \n",
      "843, a wildly inconsistent emotional experience . \n",
      "844, given how heavy-handed and portent-heavy it is , this could be the worst thing soderbergh has ever done . \n",
      "845, despite the evocative aesthetics evincing the hollow state of modern love life , the film never percolates beyond a monotonous whine . \n",
      "846, an absurdist comedy about alienation , separation and loss . \n",
      "847, ... mafia , rap stars and hood rats butt their ugly heads in a regurgitation of cinematic violence that gives brutal birth to an unlikely , but likable , hero . ' \n",
      "848, his healthy sense of satire is light and fun ... \n",
      "849, trademark american triteness and simplicity are tossed out the window with the intelligent french drama that deftly explores the difficult relationship between a father and son . \n",
      "850, miller is playing so free with emotions , and the fact that children are hostages to fortune , that he makes the audience hostage to his swaggering affectation of seriousness . \n",
      "851, impostor has a handful of thrilling moments and a couple of good performances , but the movie does n't quite fly . \n",

      "853, ( serry ) wants to blend politics and drama , an admirable ambition . \n",

      "855, it 's fascinating to see how bettany and mcdowell play off each other . \n",
      "856, in a way , the film feels like a breath of fresh air , but only to those that allow it in . \n",
      "857, visually imaginative , thematically instructive and thoroughly delightful , it takes us on a roller-coaster ride from innocence to experience without even a hint of that typical kiddie-flick sentimentality . \n",
      "858, the film 's welcome breeziness and some unbelievably hilarious moments -- most portraying the idiocy of the film industry -- make it mostly worth the trip . \n",
      "859, add yet another hat to a talented head , clooney 's a good director . \n",
      "860, stephen rea , aidan quinn , and alan bates play desmond 's legal eagles , and when joined by brosnan , the sight of this grandiloquent quartet lolling in pretty irish settings is a pleasant enough thing , ` tis . \n",
      "861, bennett 's naturalistic performance speaks volumes more truth than any ` reality ' show , and anybody contemplating their own drastic life changes should watch some body first . \n",
      "862, it 's inoffensive , cheerful , built to inspire the young people , set to an unending soundtrack of beach party pop numbers and aside from its remarkable camerawork and awesome scenery , it 's about as exciting as a sunburn . \n",
      "863, while it 's genuinely cool to hear characters talk about early rap records ( sugar hill gang , etc. ) , the constant referencing of hip-hop arcana can alienate even the savviest audiences . \n",
      "864, dull , lifeless , and amateurishly assembled . \n",
      "865, mcconaughey 's fun to watch , the dragons are okay , not much fire in the script . \n",
      "866, the far future may be awesome to consider , but from period detail to matters of the heart , this film is most transporting when it stays put in the past . \n",
      "867, has all the depth of a wading pool . \n",
      "868, a movie with a real anarchic flair . \n",
      "869, a subject like this should inspire reaction in its audience ; the pianist does not . \n",
      "870, ... is an arthritic attempt at directing by callie khouri . \n",
